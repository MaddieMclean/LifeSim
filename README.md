# LifeSim

The Artificial Life Simulator aims to process and visualise the behaviours of a variety of different artificial life forms on a 2D map. Whilst the behaviours of the lifeforms are pre-set, the user is able to save, load and run different configurations of animals, plants and obstacles to produce different maps and therefore different outcomes for the simulation. See full Artificail Life Simulator Report for full details.

The program was written in Java using the JavaFX API for the graphics. IDE used was Eclipse. 

JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX relaced Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE. JavaFX has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS.
