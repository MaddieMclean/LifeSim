# LifeSim

The Artificial Life Simulator aims to process and visualise the behaviours of a variety of different artificial life forms on a 2D map. Whilst the behaviours of the lifeforms are pre-set, the user is able to save, load and run different configurations of animals, plants and obstacles to produce different maps and therefore different outcomes for the simulation.

The program was written in Java using the JavaFX API for the graphics. IDE used was Eclipse.
